    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      TCP/IP is the protocol suite that governs how data moves across the Internet.
      You’ll learn about IP addressing, routing, TCP handshakes, and how packets travel
      from your computer to a destination server.

    <!-- Network Introduction -->
    <h2>Networks</h2>
    <p>
      We'll start off by talking about Networks. Put it simply, networks are connected things! Just like you network with 
      professionals in your field, a network can be formed between any 2+ entities. In the computing sense, it network 
      is a key term for devices that are connected together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are primarily two main types of networks: <strong>Private Networks</strong> and <strong>Public Networks</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private Networks</strong>: small networks (eg home network, business network)</li>
      <li><strong>Public Networks</strong>: connects private networks together (eg Internet)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Identifying Devices on a Network</h3>
    <p>
      There are two main ways to identify a network: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</li>
      <li>Media Access Control (MAC) Address</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- IP -->
    <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>
      We'll start off by talking about <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</strong>. IP Addresses are numericaal labels
      assigned to devices on a network. The older format was <strong>IPv4</strong>, however, as we ran out of IP addresses 
      with this format, we adopted the modern <strong>IPv6</strong> format. Below is a table that comparies the difference between 
      IPv4 vs IPv6:
    </p>
    <img 
      src="{%static 'roadmap/img/ipv4-vs-ipv6.png' %}"
      alt="IPv4 vs IPv6 Comparison Table Diagram"
    >
    <p>
      As with networks, IPs also have <strong>Public IP Addresses</strong> and <strong>Private IP Addresses</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public IP Addresses</strong>: used to identify devices on the Internet</li>
      <li><strong>Private IP Addresses</strong>: used to identify devices amongst other devices within a private network</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- MAC -->
    <h2>MAC Addresses</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses</strong> are unique identifiers for a device. Devices on a network 
      have a physical network interface (eg microchip) on its motherboard. Below are some important characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It consists of a 12 character hexadecimal number, with each pair being split by a colon</li>
      <li>First six characters are unique identifiers for the company that manufactured it</li>
      <li>Last six characters are unique to the device. </li>
    </ul>
    <img 
      src="{% static 'roadmap/img/mac-address.png' %}"
      alt="Mac Address Anatomy"
    >

    <!-- Router -->
     <h2>Router</h2>
     <p>
      <strong>Routers</strong> are devices that connects your local private network to the internet (public network). It is essentially 
      a dispatcher for your local devices: it decides where data should go (eg from device to device or device to internet). 
      The router has <strong>two IPs</strong>:
     </p>
     <ul> 
      <li><strong>Private IP</strong>: facing local devices </li>
      <li><strong>Public IP</strong>: facing internet </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Network Address Translation (NAT)</h3>
    <p>NAT is a protocol that runs inside your router, and manages multiple devices, allowing these devices to share one, singular
      public IP address. For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      
      <li>Your Phone IP: 123.456.8.9</li>
      <li>Your Laptop IP: 239.348.49.10</li>
      <li>Your Tablet IP: 289.327.29.28</li>
    </ul>
    <p>      
      But as all of these go through your router's NAT protocol, they will appear to the internet with the same  
      <strong>public IP: 203.19.192.10</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- ARP -->
    <h3>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h3>
    <p>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is what allows your local devices on your private network to recognize the router in
      that local netork. Although your laptop knows the private IP address of your router, in order to send <strong>data</strong>, 
      the laptop needs to locate the router via the router's <strong>MAC address</strong>. This protocol is called the ARP.

    <!-- Putting All Concepts Together -->
    <h2>Putting All Concepts Together</h2>
    <p>
      Now, we'll put all of these concepts into play with an example. 
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Local Network Communication (Laptop -> Router)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Your laptop needs to send data. It only knows the router's <strong>private IP</strong> (eg 158.283.12.92), not its MAC address. In order for
        your laptop to send data, it must locate your router via its <strong>MAC address</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Your laptop conducts an <strong>ARP broadcast</strong>; basically broadcasts to all the devices on its local network
      "Who has 158.283.12.92?"
      </li>
      <li>The router identifies itself directly to your laptop by responding with its <strong>MAC Address</strong>.</li>
      <li>Your laptop now sends data to your router via its MAC Address.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Router Conducts NAT (Network Address Translation) </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The router receives the data from your laptop.</li>
      <li>The router uses the NAT protocol to replacing your laptop's private IP with the router's public IP address (eg 203.19.192.10)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Router Sends Data to Internet</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Your router sends the data to the Internet to the destination server.</li>
      <li>Servers on the internet only see your <strong>public IP</strong>, never the private IPs.</li>
    </ol>

      </ul>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <details>
      <summary>What are the two types of IP addresses?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Public IP - used to identify devices on a public network (eg Internet)</li>
          <li>Private IP - used to identify devices on the same private, local network (eg your home network)</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <details>
      <summary>What is a MAC Address and what is its purpose? </summary>
        <ul>
          <li>MAC Address - is essentially your device's physical address on a local network</li>
          <li>It is used to deliver data from a device to another device on the same network</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <details>
      <summary>How is information sent from your laptop to the internet?</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Your laptop uses ARP broadcast to locate the router in its local network with a corresponding private IP</li>
        <li>The router responds to the laptop's broadcast by directly sending its MAC Address</li>
        <li>Your laptop uses this MAC Address to send data to the router</li>
        <li>The router then runs this data through NAT to assign its public IP to replace the laptop's private IP </li>
        <li>The router sends data to the desintation server on the Internet</li>
      </ol>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Internet servers can access your laptop's private IP address directly. True or False?</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>No, your laptop will present data with your router's public IP</li>
      </ul>
